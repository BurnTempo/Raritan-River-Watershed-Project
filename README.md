# Raritan-River-Watershed-Project
##Environmental Data Science Projects##
This repository contains a collection of environmental data science projects focusing on water quality, soil contamination, air pollution, and environmental impact assessment. These projects demonstrate skills in Python, R, GIS, and data visualization techniques applied to real-world environmental challenges.
